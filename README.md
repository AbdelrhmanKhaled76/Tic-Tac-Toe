# Tic Tac Toe Game (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript)

This is a fully interactive and responsive Tic Tac Toe game built using React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered by Vite for fast development.

Players can enjoy smooth transitions, dynamic turn switching, and winning detection with real-time visual feedback. Winning cells are highlighted with animated effects, and the game automatically detects both wins and draws.

Key features include responsive design for different devices, animated transitions for a polished experience, "Play Again" functionality for quick resets, and SEO-optimized meta information. The entire project is type-safe with TypeScript, ensuring robust state management and cleaner code.

Ideal for showcasing modern front-end development practices including state management, conditional rendering, responsive design, and basic animation techniques.
